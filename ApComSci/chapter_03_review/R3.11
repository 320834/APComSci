Exercise R3.11. Suppose you want to implement a class Savi ngsAccount. A savings
account is similar to a bank account, but it has an interest rate and accumulates
interest once a year. Design the public interface for this class.


	/**
	*This class accumulates interest once a year
	*/
public class SavingsAccound(){
	public SavingsAccount(int accountNumber, double initialBalance, double interestRate){
	}	
	
	/**
	*This class gets the balance.
	*@return balance returns the balance
	*/
	public double getBalance(){
	}
}
