Exercise R2.7. Repeat Exercise R2.6, but now define object variables that are initialized
with the required objects. 

(Exercise R2.6. Give Java code to construct the following objects:
a. A rectangle with center (100, 100) and all side lengths equal to 50
b. A string "Hello, Dave!"
Create objects, not object variables.)

a. Rectangle box = new Rectangle(100, 100, 50, 50);
b. String hello = "Hello, Dave!";
