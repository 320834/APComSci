Exercise R2.10. Look into the API documentation of the Rectangle class and locate
the method
void add(int newx, int newy)
Read through the method documentation. Then determine the result of the following
statements:
Rectangle box = new Rectangle(5, 10, 20, 30);
box.add(O, 0);
If you are not sure, write a small test program or use Blue].

the Rectangle will have bounds x = 0, y = 0, width = 25, height = 40;
