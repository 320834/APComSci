Exercise R6.3. Explain the difference between an if/else/else statement and nested
if statements. Give an example for each.

For example, an if else else statement is when if something is true the elses wont be run
If condition is true, only statement 1 is run, if condition is false but condition 2 is true, statement 2 is run and the next if is not tested
if(condition)
	statement1;
else if(condition2)
		statement2;
	else if(condition3)
			statement 3;
			
Nested if's are to narrow something down into sections If condition is true then the next if is run and if condition 2 is un and if the next if is true then finallly statement will be run

if(condition)
	if(condition2)
		if(condition3)
			statement;
