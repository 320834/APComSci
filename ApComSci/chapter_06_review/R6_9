Exercise R6.9. Explain the difference between
s = 0;
if (x > 0) s++;
if (y > 0) s++;
and
s = 0;
if (x > 0) s++;
else if (y > 0) s++;

In the first one it checks twice so if x = 1, y = 1;
then s would equal 2

However, in the second one, if the first if is true, the else is skipped so if x = 1, y = 1
s would equal 1
