Exercise R6.4. Give an example for an ; f / e 1 se/ else statement where the order of the
tests does not matter. Give an example where the order of the tests matters.

Doesn't matter:	In this case it doesn't matter because only if x is the number then the conditions are true
				It doesn't matter if the order is changed around
if(x == 1)
  return 4;
else if(x == 2)
   	     return 234;
else if(x == 3)
		return 231;
		
		
Does Matter: One example is labeling systems like grades.	If it was reversed, anything above 70 even if it's a 100, would be labeled as a C

if(grade > 90)
	return 'A';
else if(grade > 80)
 		return 'B';
else if (grade > 70)
		return 'C';
